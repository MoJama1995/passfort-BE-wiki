# passfort-BE-wiki

A small API that handles incoming requests to fetch plain text documents - written in Node.js.
Jest is used for unit testing and SuperTest for the integration testing.

Due to time constraints I have only set up the routes for the timestamp routes, as I wanted to focus more on testing/best practices. 
For any questions, do not hesitate to contact me via email :). 

## How to run the project 
Clone this repository and run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies.
Run `npm start` in order to spin up the express server. 
Run `npm test` to run all tests, and you can run `npm test -- filter` to filter for test suites.
